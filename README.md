<p align="center">
  I'm a software engineer in training, still figuring out how to be "that" engineer everyone talks about. Always eager to dive into whatever the internet throws my way. Big fan of HTMXâ€”because why complicate things with React when you can keep it simple and dynamic?

## ðŸ”§ Languages & Tools

I dabble in Python, JavaScript, Java, Swift, Go, and C++â€”basically, if it's a programming language, I'm probably trying to learn it. From databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL to tools like Git, Docker, and AWS, I'm on a never-ending journey to master the essentials of software development. Always open to exploring new technologies that the internet throws at me!
